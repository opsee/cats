gmunch
======

gmunch can run in standalone worker mode (no server), or in full server mode with a grpc endpoint and client for sending events. 
No docs yet, but check out the [example server](./examples/server/main.go) or the [example worker](./examples/worker/main.go) for how to set up a gmunch. The [example client](./examples/client/main.go) shows how to send events to a gmunch server.
